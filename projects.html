                <h3>Project 1: Case Study 1 – Networking Design</h3>
                <p>Description: In this project, I designed the IPv4 addressing scheme and routing configuration for a corporate network consisting of three interconnected buildings. The work included applying VLSM for efficient IP allocation, configuring static routes on multiple routers, and ensuring connectivity between all hosts and an external internet server. The design was then implemented and tested in Cisco Packet Tracer to verify successful communication across the network. </p>

                <h3>Project 2: Movie Ticket Booking System (Python, GUI)</h3>
                <p>Description: This project involved building a Python-based desktop application that allowed users to book movie tickets through an interactive graphical interface. I contributed to implementing seat selection, booking logic, and file handling for data persistence, while also working with teammates to design the admin panel for managing schedules and movies. The system integrated payment simulation and error handling to ensure reliable and user-friendly functionality.</p>

                <h3>Project 3: Computer Architecture Project - Comparative Analysis of ARMv7 and RISC-V Architectures</h3>
                <p>Description: In this project, we compared ARMv7 and RISC-V through both research and practical coding tasks. An arithmetic calculator was implemented on ARMv7 and a Fibonacci generator on RISC-V to observe differences in efficiency and design. The study highlighted ARMv7’s commercial maturity versus RISC-V’s flexibility and open-source nature.</p>

                <h3>Project 5: Community Mosque Inventory System </h3>
                <p>Description:For this project, I created a detailed Excel sheet to track supplies and merchandise for my local mosque. The system organized inventory counts clearly and made updates easier, helping improve management of resources.</p>
